#Preprocess to Present Calls Functions and Prep

#working directory should contain
#3 Directories
## CEL Liver Files - 2218 CEL liver files downloaded from DrugMatrix, ensure all files are present when proceeding
## Supplementary_Files - 
### Containing target of phenodatatxt currently "Supplementary_Files/Corrected_Affymetrix_Microarray_Data_Labels_spreadsheet_02_23_2012.txt"
### eventually should include 
#### desired chemical conditions for testing .xlsx file
#### detailed treatment to control mappings text table file 
## and Workspaces_and_Objects 
### directory for storing objects created to save expression sets at checkpoints in the analysis

#function to make mappings between experimental and control arrays based on Drugmatrix annotation data

#output- ArrayMatch-data frame that has info for an experimental condition matched with information for a variable number of control arrays including the name of the control array
#ArrayMatch-should have multiple lines with the same experimental condition with one line for each control match, the same control may be matched to multiple experimental conditions but will not be matched multiple times to the same condition...
